## Notes on projects, processes, and products at the places I work at.
  
  This will include setup of test environments, common process notes and FAQ's for myself.

  TODO here

- Process of making pull requests
  we don't hah

- Process of running tests with selenium grid / links to documentation
  tests run automatically at night, running during the daytime is easy and I have the documentation bookmarked.

- Process of getting an environment set up for working / Notes from my initiatory phase
  This is well documented, no need for notes specific to setup.

- Freelance opportunities? Upwork, Utest3 Testlio Userfeel (Testlio looks good)

- Process for creating tests for a Simulation
1. Automate the sim.
2. Manual test on chrome and one other browser (try to set up the mac or chromebook or something.)
3. Enter the manual cases into testrail
4. Report any bugs found into Jira.
