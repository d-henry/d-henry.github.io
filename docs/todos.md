## Things I need to do here in my markdown pages

- Selenium project samples / starters in both Java and Python
- Documentation on my Truenas Scale setup 
- Figure out how to have the repository be private while the pages are public... (private repo, public gh-pages branch)
- Document how gh-pages works for myself and any friends I'd like to show
- Document test reporting and CI integration.
- Document more advanced processes for Selenium (Actions, sliders, verifying states etc.)
- Create a list/compendium of product recommendations for friends. headphones, keebs, mice, mousepads, pc builds, etc.
