These resources are for both Java and Python. Documentation Python Docs Java Docs Selenium Docs Why POM? Recommended Reading For Python I recommend the Python crash course (2nd edition) Textbook. For Java i was mostly taught in university classes, however this Is a decent introduction. For Selenium I recommend Tech With Tim's videos for an absolute beginner's introduction They can be found here. Basic Selenium Operations in Python Click an element -- some_button_element.click() Send text to a field -- some_field_element.send_keys(\"text here\") Select an option from a dropdown or select list There are several ways to achieve this, this is just one example. First we find the Select element. in the Sorenson project It would look like this. select_element = self.browser.find_element(*self.SOME_SELECT) Where browser is our WebDriver and *self.SOME_SELECT is our locator reference. Then we create a Select Object and assign the element to it select_object = Select(select_element) Then we can select by visible text select_object.select_by_visible_text(\"some option\") Verify an element (like a checkbox) is enabled. is_enabled = some_element.is_enabled() This will set is_enabled to either true or false, which we can then assert against using pytest assert(is_enabled) Common issues and roadblocks ElementNotFound Exceptions By far the most common issue you will ever see creating and maintaining Selenium Test Automation and one of the most annoying to try and fix. This exception occurs (usually) when the WebDriver attempts to access or manipulate an element that hasn't yet been loaded into the DOM , or is not displayed. There are several things you should check here. First, is it a timing issue? Selenium has three types of waits built in for us to use, and it's important to understand all three. Explicit wait , typically used as a wait until some condition is true. e.g element to be clickable / visible. Implicit wait , used to wait for any element, this is more of a configuration setting then something you actually do in code. Fluent wait , useful for ignoring exceptions that may arise while waiting, such as ElementNotVisibleException or ElementNotSelectableException For more information on waits, please see the Documentation Why isn't intellisense working for selenium??? This is a problem I ran into, and have yet to solve for python with selenium unless i'm using Pycharm. If i'm using pycharm my solution was to use a Type Hint Otherwise it's most commonly a package / import issue. make sure you followed the correct steps to install selenium for the language you are using and that it has been added to the project in your IDE .","title":"Selenium"},{"location":"selenium/#selenium-resources","text":"A list of resources, documentation, courses, and tips for selenium test automation.
